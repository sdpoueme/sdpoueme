# Tech Founder of Camidus (2012-2018)

As the founder of Camidus ([camidus.com](https://camidus.com/)), I spearheaded the company's mission to tackle critical land tenure and property rights challenges, particularly prevalent in developing nations across Africa, including my native Cameroon. This endeavor was deeply rooted in a personal understanding of the impact of land disputes and a commitment to leveraging engineering expertise for societal good.

Camidus developed an innovative land information platform, sometimes referred to as CALAR (Cadastre and Land Register), designed to modernize and secure land administration systems. Our approach integrated geospatial technologies, cloud computing, mobile accessibility, and robust urban planning principles. A key aspect of our solution was the electronic management of cadastre and land registry data, aiming to bring transparency, efficiency, and reliability to a traditionally complex and often opaque sector. We also explored integrations like what3words to enhance addressing capabilities within our system.

The overarching goal of Camidus was multi-faceted: to reduce poverty by securing property rights, thereby enabling citizens to leverage their land as an asset; to underpin sustainable economic development and attract investment; to promote social inclusion by ensuring equitable access to land information; and to contribute to improved food security and the realization of human rights. In the early stages, around 2015, we launched a GoFundMe campaign to rally support for the development and implementation of our platform in Cameroon, emphasizing citizen empowerment through features like self-service kiosks for land-related inquiries.

Furthermore, Camidus envisioned transforming traditional cities into intelligent and resilient urban environments. This included a focus on "Smart Citizens," aiming to empower individuals with better access to information and tools for interacting with urban and land management systems, alongside initiatives for sustainable urban economic development and emergency response.

Our work and vision at Camidus garnered significant recognition:

* **Total Startupper of the Year in Cameroon (2016):** Awarded 3rd prize for our innovative approach to solving local challenges.

* **Social & Inclusive Business Camp (2019):** Participation in this camp further refined our business model for social impact.

Through Camidus, we actively engaged in projects across Africa, driven by the conviction that secure land rights are foundational to building prosperous, equitable, and intelligent societies.
